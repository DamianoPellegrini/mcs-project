# Assignment - Metodi del Calcolo Scientifico - Cholesky Decomposition

This project aims to compare proprietary and open-source solutions for the resolution of scattered linear systems using Cholesky factorization.
It will be analyzed how, through a personalized implementation, interesting results were obtained compared to the proprietary solutions examined,
deepening the challenges encountered during the development process.
